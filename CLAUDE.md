See the following for details.

- Frontmatter & Emoji selection: `docs/article-frontmatter.md`
- Japanese writing rules & textlint: `docs/writing-rules.md`

## Writing Rules (always applied)

- Body text uses polite form (ですます調), headings/lists use plain form (である調)
- End sentences with "。" (colon "：" is prohibited)
- Do not use level-3 headings (###) without user permission
- Do not use bold (`**`) as a substitute for headings
- Do not repeat the same particle in one sentence

## Linting

- **Pre-commit hook** runs textlint automatically
- Do not run textlint manually from Claude Code (only when explicitly requested by user)
- Adding textlint suppression comments requires user permission (also blocked by Hooks)
- Skipping with `--no-verify` is prohibited (also blocked by Hooks)

## Git Operations

- **Main branch**: `main` (PR required, direct push prohibited; also blocked by Hooks)
- **Branch naming**: `article/<slug>` (articles), `docs/<topic>` (documentation)
- Verify `published: true` before creating a PR
